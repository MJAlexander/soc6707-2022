In SOC6707 we will be using the statistical programming language R through the RStudio environment. You will need to install both R and RStudio onto your computer. This document describes the steps of installation, and provides a test to make sure everything is working properly. 

# Install R

1. Go to http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/
2. Select the download link that is relevant to you: if you have a Mac, select "Download R for (Mac) OS X", if you have a Windows machine, select "Download R for Windows". 
3. If you have a Mac, click on the "R-4.0.2.pkg" link. If you have a Windows machine, click on the "base" link, then click on the "Download R 4.0.2 for Windows" link.
4. Open the downloaded file and follow the install instructions on your machine.


# Install RStudio

1. Go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
2. Scroll down and click the "Download" button under "RStudio Desktop Open Source License Free"
3. Click the "Download RStudio" button (it will either say for Mac or Windows)
4. Open the downloaded file and follow the install instructions on your machine.

# Install tinytex

You may need to install a TeX distribution (you probably will). If you're not sure if you have one, go to the next step ("Check everything worked by knitting a RMarkdown document"), and if it doesn't work, you will need to install tinytex. 

1. Open RStudio
2. Click in the Console window (on the left)
3. Type `install.packages('tinytex')` after the `>` and press return 
4. Type `tinytex::install_tinytex()` after the `>` and press return (see below)
